# Art of Chicago App :)

Hey there guys! This is a React Native mobile app made as a Challenge for Modak.

Please feel free to leave any kind of feedback, that its what makes us grow even more :)

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Install all dependencies

First, you will need to install all **project dependencies**. So lets give it a cool and fresh yarn or npm install üßë‚Äçüç≥

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

And dont forget of ios pods as wel!!

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Step 222222, lets start **Metro**.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start the awesome Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulatorrrrr_ or _iOS Simulatorrrrr_.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively as we already know.

## And thatssss ittt! :tada:
